		<h2>About This Tutorial</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			In this tutorial you will learn how to browse the Nanvix's source 
			code, build it and generate a live image from it. Details about the 
			source code itself are not covered here so, if you want to learn 
			more about Nanvix, you can refer to the 
			<a href="./documentation.html">Nanvix Documentation</a>. 
		</p>
		<h2>The Programming Environment</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			Nanvix is written in C and x86 assembly, and natively supports the 
			ELF executable file type. Therefore, in  order to build Nanvix 
			you need at least a linker, a standard C compiler and a x86 
			assembler, that together produce a ELF 32 binary file.	However, not every 
			tool chain with such features will correctly build Nanvix, since there are some portions of the 
			project, like the assembly source code files, that are highly 
			tool chain dependent. To make things easier, we strongly recommend 
			you to use the following tools:
			<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">GNU Binutils</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.nasm.us/">NASM</a></li>
			</ul>
			It is important to notice that, if you are using a 64-bit platform, you may need to
			setup a x86 cross-compiler.
			Also, we encourage you to use a GNU/Linux operating system, since 
			all the tools listed above and many other useful development tools 
			are available for it.
		</p>
		<h3>The Nanvix Source Code</h3>
		<p align="justify">
			At the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/nanvix/files/src/'>
			Nanvix Source Code Repository</a> you can download the source code of 
			any Nanvix version that you want. Nanvix versions are quite easy to 
			understand: the first release was Nanvix 0.01 and, at each release, 
			the version number increases. 
			Versions prior to Nanvix 0.05 are considered Beta Versions meaning 
			that, among many other things, they don't follow the standard source 
			code tree established since Nanvix 0.05 and presented hereafter.
		</p>
		<p align='justify'>
			<i><b>bin/</b></i><br>
			The binary directory is the output directory where compiled binary files
			are placed. 
			After building Nanvix, the kernel executable image 
			will be located there, along with other binary files.
		</p>
		<p align='justify'>
			<i><b>doc/</b></i><br>
			The documentation directory is the place where all documentation delivered
			with the source code is located. At least the license file is 
			located there. If you have the source code of Nanvix without this file, 
			please contact us providing further information about where you	found 
			this source code.
		</p>
		<p align='justify'>
			<i><b>img/</b></i><br>
			In the image directory you will find a blank GRUB image and other GRUB 
			related files. We will talk about them later when showing you how to
			generating a live image.
		</p>
		<p align='justify'>
			<i><b>include/</b></i><br>
			The include directory is the place where all public header files are 
			located.
		</p>
		<p align='justify'>
			<i><b>lib/</b></i><br>
			The library directory is the output directory where compiled static 
			and dynamic libraries are placed. After building Nanvix the c library
			will be located there, with other libraries.
		</p>
		<p align='justify'>
			<i><b>src/</b></i><br>
			The source directory is the place where the source code of all 
			Nanvix projects' branches are.
		</p>
		<p align='justify'>
			<i><b>tools/</b></i><br>
			The tools directory contains the source code of tools used for
			generating the live image.
		</p>
		<h3>Building Nanvix</h3>
		<p align='justify'>
		If you are using the suggested tool chain, building any version of Nanvix
		is not complicated at all: just go to the root directory of the Nanvix 
		project and run the makefile. Any compilation error indicate that your
		tool chain is not properly configured. Once the building has finished, 
		all binaries are placed on the <i>bin</i> directory, including the 
		kernel image.
		</p>
		<h3>Generating a Live Nanvix Image</h3>
		Independently which version you are using, generating a live system 
		image is very simple:
			<ul>
				<li>Get a blank live image 
				<a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/nanvix/files/img/'>here</a>.</li>
				<li>Mount it using your preferred tool (ex: mount on Unix systems
				or Daemon Tools on Windows)</li>
				<li>Place the kernel image file in<i>/bin/</i> directory.</li>
			</ul> 
		<p align='justify'>
		If you are attempting to generate a live image from a Nanvix version 
		higher than 0.04, additionally, you should build and run the 
		<i>install</i> utility in order to create the <i>initrd</i> image. 
		Then, you just need to place it in the root directory of the mounted 
		live image.
